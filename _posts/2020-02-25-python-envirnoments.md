-   Whenever you install any library or package from `pip` it will be installed on global level. This is fine if you are working on one or one kind of projects. But what if:-
    -   you need different libraries version for different projects? 
    -   you want to distribute your project to another user or lab to reproduce the same results?
-   For this **Virtual Envirnoments** are used.
    -   **Virtual Envirnoments** helps python project in dependency management, project distribution and project isolation.
